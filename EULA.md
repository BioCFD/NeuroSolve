**What is NeuroCFD™?**

Neurovascular disease, including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, is the second leading cause of death globally and the third leading cause of premature death and disability . There are over 12.2 million new strokes each year with 6.5 million deaths in 2022 . NeuroCFD™ is a medical simulation technology protocol designed to enable personalised neurovascular medicine. 
NeuroCFD™ is a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technology protocol created to advance personalized management and in silico trials for neurovascular medicine. The goal of NeuroCFD™ is to advance medical care for millions of neurovascular patients around the world. By using NeuroCFD™, neurovascular interventionalists will make management decisions for every patient objectively, neutralizing the statistical bias in status-quo management standards. NeuroCFD™ is also useful for the research and development of endovascular repair (EVR) devices. NeuroCFD™ streamlines in silico trials to expedite, optimize, and streamline EVR R&D with the ability to couple the simulations with in vitro and in vivo disease models.
Based on high-fidelity Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and non-Newtonian blood viscosity models , NeuroCFD™ offers unprecedented insights to neurovascular interventionalists. By creating accurate hemodynamic digital twin for patients with neurovascular disorders, neurovascular interventionalists can reduce management risk and improve patient outcomes. 
The value offering and promise of NeuroCFD™ are all about democratizing CFD and translating it to the medical community. With zero-prerequisite knowledge of CFD and fluid mechanics, neurovascular surgeons and radiologists can now capture the value of medical simulation and make better decisions. 

**NeuroSolve is the open-source implementation of NeuroCFD™**

In August 2023, Bio-CFD Inc (DE USA) has authorized a resolution to become Bio-CFD Foundation (non-profit, London UK), releasing NeuroCFD™ to the global community under open-source license. This decision was made by 100% of the Bio-CFD Inc shareholders, in response to the medical-technology challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and in contribution to the global open-science movement. To ensure the rapid adoption, scalability, and sustainability of NeuroCFD™ technology protocol, an open-source implementation was developed based on the open-source general-CFD framework OpenFOAM® . The NeuroSolve code is released on GitHub and is made available worldwide free of charge. NeuroSolve is based on NeuroCFD™ v2.7 authorized on 19 August 2022. The Bio-CFD Foundation will continue to hold all versions of the NeuroCFD™ protocol released after v2.7 as private assets of the foundation.
